# Moving to Zig

So you're a business programmer used to higher languages with a GC like C# to
write CRUD apps at work and you yearn for something different and deeper. You
want to write business applications in Zig! I'm wanting to make the move but
do not have machine-programming experience. This will track some of my notes on
this process.

I want a high-level guide of topics that will help me write with Zig but also a
primer or warning of problems/things that I'll immediately start running into as
I begin writing Zig programs as someone who comes from C# and Javascript.
